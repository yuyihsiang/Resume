abstract = {The aim of this paper is to describe a procedure to maximize the power-to-load ratio of a novel wave energy converter (WEC) that combines an oscillating surge wave energy converter with variable structural components. The control of the power-take-off torque will be on a wave-to-wave timescale, whereas the structure will be controlled statically such that the geometry remains the same throughout the wave period. Linear hydrodynamic theory is used to calculate the upper and lower bounds for the time-averaged absorbed power and surge foundation loads while assuming that the WEC motion remains sinusoidal. Previous work using pseudo-spectral techniques to solve the optimal control problem focused solely on maximizing absorbed energy. This work extends the optimal control problem to include a measure of the surge foundation force in the optimization. The objective function includes two competing terms that force the optimizer to maximize power capture while minimizing structural loads. A penalty weight was included with the surge foundation force that allows control of the optimizer performance based on whether emphasis should be placed on power absorption or load shedding. Results from pseudo-spectral optimal control indicate that a unit reduction in time-averaged power can be accompanied by a greater reduction in surge-foundation force.},

The corresponding hydrodynamic loads on the hull are determined, and the results are compared with published experimental data. The present method is applied to several hull shapes subject to prescribed roll motions or in transient roll-decay motions. It is found that, due to the effects of viscosity, the results are nonlinear with roll angle, even for small angles. From the analyzed hull geometries, the one with 4{\%} bilge keels was found to be the most effective in reducing roll motions.},

abstract = {The paper presents the development of BEM (Boundary Element Method) and FVM (Finite Volume Method) based models for the analysis of the flow around 2-D FPSO hull-sections fitted with bilge keels and subject to forced roll motions. Through these models an attempt is made to gain an insight into the two important aspects of the flow : separation around bilge keels and the effect of the free-surface. The effect of the free-surface and the resulting wave-body interaction is studied using a 2-D BEM model coupled with a Mixed-Eulerian- Lagrangian (MEL) time marching scheme for the free-surface boundary conditions. The separation around the bilge keels and viscous aspects of the flow are studied using a FVM based 2-D Navier Stokes (2DNS) solver with linear free-surface boundary conditions. The primary aim of the BEM model is to investigate the effects of the linear and nonlinear boundary conditions on the predicted flow within the scope of the parameters of the FVM model.
